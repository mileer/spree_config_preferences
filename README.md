SpreeConfigPreferences
======================

This extension overrides Spree's default behavior of saving and loading application preferences in the database.

Installation
------------

Add spree_config_preferences to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_config_preferences'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_config_preferences:install
```

Replace reference to `Spree::Preferences::Store.instance` in [Spree](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/2-2-stable/core/app/models/spree/preferences/preferable.rb#L137) to `Spree::Preferences::InMemoryStore.instance`.

To load the configuration settings into the InMemoryStore instance, define the configuration files you wish to load in `application.rb`.
```ruby
config.spree_config_preferences_preference_files = [ABSOLUTE_FILEPATH, SECOND_ABSOLUTE_FILEPATH]
config.spree_config_preferences_model_preference_files = [ABSOLUTE_FILEPATH, SECOND_ABSOLUTE_FILEPATH]
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_config_preferences/factories'
```
